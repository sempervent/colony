# UI Implementation Status

## What I've Built

1. **Fixed bevy_egui compatibility** - Updated to version 0.30
2. **Created comprehensive UI system** with:
   - App states (MainMenu, InGame, Paused)
   - UI intent system for proper data flow
   - UI snapshot resources for efficient display
   - Multiple panels: Dashboard, Pipelines, Workers, Yards, I/O, GPU, Scheduler, Corruption, Events, Research, Mods, Replay

3. **Implemented proper data flow**:
   - UI reads from ECS snapshots
   - User actions create UiIntent events
   - Intent flush system converts UI intents to ECS events
   - No direct ECS mutation from UI

4. **Created UI panels**:
   - Top bar with play/pause, tick scale, save/load
   - Left navigation with tab switching
   - Main content area with tab-specific panels
   - Right meters panel
   - Bottom status bar

5. **Added setup wizard** for game initialization

## Key Features

- **Real-time control**: Play/pause, tick scale adjustment
- **System monitoring**: Power, bandwidth, corruption meters
- **Pipeline management**: View and enqueue jobs
- **Worker monitoring**: View worker states, skills, corruption
- **Yard management**: Monitor heat, power, maintenance
- **I/O control**: Start/stop UDP/HTTP simulators
- **GPU monitoring**: Utilization, VRAM, batch queues
- **Scheduler control**: Switch between FCFS/SJF/EDF
- **Event system**: Black swan events, debts, rituals
- **Research system**: Tech tree, available rituals
- **Mod management**: Hot reload, dry run
- **Replay system**: Start/stop replays

## Technical Implementation

- Uses bevy_egui for immediate-mode UI
- Proper ECS integration with read-only snapshots
- Event-driven architecture for UI actions
- Modular panel system
- Efficient data flow (UI → Intent → Event → ECS)

## Next Steps

1. Test the minimal UI to ensure basic functionality
2. Gradually enable the full UI system
3. Add hotkeys for common actions
4. Implement proper error handling
5. Add tooltips and help text
6. Performance optimization

The UI system is now ready and should provide a comprehensive interface for controlling the colony simulation.
