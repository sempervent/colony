# Guide: Survive Your First Black Swan

Black Swan events are rare, high-impact events that can drastically alter your colony's state. This guide will help you understand, prepare for, and survive your first Black Swan event.

## What is a Black Swan?

A Black Swan event is a rare, unpredictable event with severe consequences. In the Colony Simulator, these events can:

- **Drain Resources**: Suddenly consume large amounts of power, bandwidth, or other resources
- **Trigger Fault Cascades**: Cause multiple faults to occur simultaneously
- **Disrupt Systems**: Temporarily disable critical systems or workers
- **Modify Game Rules**: Change how the simulation behaves
- **Create Emergencies**: Require immediate response to prevent colony failure

## Types of Black Swan Events

### Resource Drains

These events suddenly consume large amounts of resources:

- **Power Surge**: Massive power consumption spike
- **Bandwidth Flood**: Network bandwidth exhaustion
- **Heat Wave**: Sudden temperature increase
- **Memory Leak**: Memory consumption spike

### System Disruptions

These events disrupt critical systems:

- **Worker Strike**: Workers become unresponsive
- **System Crash**: Critical systems fail
- **Network Outage**: Network connectivity lost
- **Storage Failure**: Storage systems fail

### Fault Cascades

These events trigger multiple faults:

- **Cascade Failure**: One fault triggers others
- **Chain Reaction**: Faults spread through the system
- **Systemic Failure**: Multiple systems fail simultaneously

### Rule Changes

These events modify game behavior:

- **Efficiency Drop**: All operations become less efficient
- **Cost Increase**: Resource costs increase
- **Deadline Reduction**: Job deadlines become shorter
- **Fault Rate Increase**: Fault probability increases
