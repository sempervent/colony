# Player Manual: Basics

Welcome to the Colony Simulator! This guide will teach you the fundamentals of managing a computational colony.

## üéØ What is a Colony?

A **colony** is a distributed system of workers that process data through complex pipelines. Your job is to manage resources, handle faults, and keep your colony running efficiently.

### Core Concepts

- **Workers**: The heart of your colony, processing data through various operations
- **Workyards**: Facilities where workers operate (CPU arrays, GPU farms, signal hubs)
- **Pipelines**: Sequences of operations that transform incoming data
- **Resources**: Power, heat, bandwidth, and corruption that affect performance
- **Events**: Black Swans, research breakthroughs, and system failures

## üè≠ Colony Components

### Workers

Workers are the backbone of your colony. Each worker has:

- **Class**: CPU, GPU, or I/O specialization
- **Skills**: Efficiency ratings for different operation types
- **State**: Idle, running, or faulted
- **Discipline**: Resistance to corruption
- **Focus**: Concentration level affecting performance

### Workyards

Workyards are facilities that house and manage workers:

- **CPU Array**: General-purpose processing with moderate heat generation
- **GPU Farm**: High-performance parallel processing with significant heat
- **Signal Hub**: I/O operations with low heat but bandwidth requirements

### Pipelines

Pipelines define how data flows through your colony:

- **UDP Demux**: Network packet processing
- **HTTP Parse**: Web request handling
- **Decode**: Data decompression
- **Kalman**: Signal processing
- **FFT**: Frequency analysis
- **Yolo**: AI inference (GPU only)

## ‚ö° Resource Management

### Power System

Your colony consumes power to operate:

- **Power Cap**: Maximum power your colony can draw
- **Power Draw**: Current power consumption
- **Power Deficit**: When draw exceeds cap, causing system degradation

**Tips:**
- Monitor power consumption closely
- Upgrade power capacity before adding more workers
- Power deficits cause immediate performance loss

### Heat Management

Workers generate heat during operation:

- **Heat Generation**: Based on operation complexity and worker efficiency
- **Heat Capacity**: Maximum heat a workyard can handle
- **Thermal Throttling**: Automatic performance reduction when heat is high

**Tips:**
- Keep heat below 80% of capacity for optimal performance
- GPU operations generate more heat than CPU operations
- High heat increases fault rates

### Bandwidth Utilization

Data flows through your colony's network:

- **Bandwidth Cap**: Maximum data throughput
- **Utilization**: Current bandwidth usage
- **Latency**: Delay caused by high utilization

**Tips:**
- Monitor bandwidth during peak processing
- High utilization increases processing delays
- I/O operations are most affected by bandwidth limits

### Corruption Field

Corruption represents system degradation:

- **Corruption Rate**: How quickly corruption increases
- **Decay Rate**: Natural corruption reduction
- **Effects**: Higher corruption increases fault rates

**Tips:**
- Keep corruption below 10% for stable operation
- Research can reduce corruption rates
- Faults increase corruption significantly

## üìä Understanding Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Throughput**: Data processed per second
- **Latency**: Average processing delay
