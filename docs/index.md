# Asynchronous Colony Simulator

Welcome to the **Asynchronous Colony Simulator** - a comprehensive simulation of computational colonies with advanced modding support, deterministic replay, and real-time performance optimization.

## üéØ What is Colony Simulator?

The Colony Simulator is a sophisticated simulation engine that models computational colonies - distributed systems of workers processing data through complex pipelines. It combines real-time resource management, fault tolerance, and modding capabilities to create an engaging and educational experience.
